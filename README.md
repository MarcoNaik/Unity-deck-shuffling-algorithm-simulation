# Deck Shuffling Algorithm Simulation.
This is a small university proyect in which I made a simulation about an algorithm we were meant to analize.

The algorithm consist in taking the bottom card and putting it into any place of the deck (even on the top or bottom again) and it ends when every card has been shuffled. This simulation shows the average steps that it takes experimally and compares it to an theorical average which is calculated by nH(n-1). Where H(n) is an *Harmonic Number.*
